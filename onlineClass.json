      "description": "HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. "

      "description": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a fundamental technology in web development, allowing you to control the design and layout of your web pages. It works by targeting HTML elements and defining their appearance using rules consisting of selectors, properties, and values. With CSS, you can change colors, fonts, create responsive layouts, set backgrounds, add animations, and much more. For beginners, it's essential to grasp the basics of CSS syntax, selectors, and the box model, which defines an element's size and spacing. As you progress, you can explore advanced topics like responsive web design and CSS best practices. CSS is a powerful tool for making your web content visually appealing and user-friendly."
